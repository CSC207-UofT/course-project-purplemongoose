# Kard-server

Kard-server is the Java server backend for kard.

This program starts a Java Spring server on port 8082 and accepts HTTP requests to interact with the SQLite database.

Run this project on your computer before running either of the kard user interfaces as they rely on this program to serve as the backend.
