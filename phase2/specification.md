> *Note: an \*(asterisk) denotes an option that was not implemented due to time constraints. Given another month to develop *kard*, these features would be implemented as we have left profiles open to extension

The application will be accessible through the follow methods:

- Java CLI Application (See [kard-CLI](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-purplemongoose/tree/main/kard-CLI))
- Web Application (Can be generated given that the app was created using the Flutter Framework)
- Android Application (See [kard](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-purplemongoose/tree/main/kard))
- iOS/iPadOS Application (See [kard](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-purplemongoose/tree/main/kard))

The local applications will run solely to present the data in a user-viewable mannder. They do not contain any functionality to do computation on the data.
